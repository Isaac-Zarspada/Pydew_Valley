# so Zoe this is a tutorial for you I want you to notice the name of this file, it's called zoe_tut.py
# the .PY part of the file name tells you what kind of file it is .py i short for python and that means the file is suppose to be read a certain way by the computer.

# this line right here starts with a hashtag, in python a hastag tells the computer to ignore the text

# you can comment multiple lines
# at the same time by highlighting
# the stuff you want to comment out
# and then pressing ctl + / 

# next we're going to talk about simple stuff like objects
# so think of an object as a box, you can put different things in

# each box is defined by one equal siogn =

box = 1

# in the example below I made an object and since I put a 1 inside it's a certain type of object called an integer which just means whole number

word = "hello"

# this guy is an object called word and I put a string inside it which just means text, in order to make a string you need to put quotes around it ""

# try making a a string object called name and put your name as a string inside.

name = 'zoe'

now that you made your name object we are going to make a sentence using iter

here is a sentence object fill out the objects below with strings #don't forget to comment out the errors and comments

pau_name

#make this sentence into an object called sentence and make sure it's in quotes like a string should be.
